What is Vana Mind?
------------------

Stress is an inevitable part of life. No matter how perfectly planned a day might be, anything and everything can go wrong and throw an entire day into disarray. Even something like a typical stressful drive to work could be enough for someone to decide that they are completely done with everything around them. While meditations and mantras can offer the inner peace needed to deal with daily situations, some consumers seek medicinal help to gain control over their emotions.

Even though stress sometimes feels like a problem that adds to the weight of the day, it isn’t necessarily from outside influences. The body produces cortisol – the hormone associated with stress – as soon as the pituitary gland gets the signal from the body. This cortisol can be triggered by exercise, experiencing a stressful event, or even waking up. The brain sends an alert to the adrenal glands, telling them exactly how much cortisol it needs to make. This process only takes about 15 minutes after a stressful event occurs to release and can last for hours.

No one wants to constantly experience anxiety and stress, especially when these two catalysts can hyperdrive cortisol, making you feel edgy and jittery. Some people need help getting back on track, so Vana Mind is gaining so much attention. Even just a quick peek online shows how much customers love the relief it gives, but what exactly is it?

Vana Mind helps consumers to lower their stress by delivering CBD and other essential ingredients to the body, regulating the stress response. This formula uses some of the latest processing techniques to ensure that anyone can get relief. The reviews from other customers explain that using this formula helps them experience more of the goodness around them, helping them feel like themselves in a way other products don’t. With praise for the inner peace and relaxation that Vana Mind offers, it is no secret how effective it might be.

Dealing with stress can be overwhelming, which is how many people end up with a therapist or a doctor to regulate it. Unfortunately, some of these medical professionals are a little apprehensive about writing prescriptions, and it can take a while to find a formula that works for the users' particular needs. Some people cannot get a prescription because their concerns don’t warrant one. With Vana Mind, consumers don’t have to meet any criteria or speak with doctors. If they have stress and anxiety, the broad-spectrum CBD in Vana Mind is the solution.

What Makes Vana Mind So Powerful?
---------------------------------

The main reason that Vana Mind has such an incredible effect on stress is that it offers alkaloids among its ingredients. Alkaloids are a compound that plants and some fungi carry, and they naturally contain nitrogen. Some examples of alkaloids that consumers might recognize include nicotine, caffeine, and codeine, which are all used in different ways to support the body. Some alkaloids treat cancer. They are heavily researched in the pharmaceutical industry because they offer antibacterial, antiviral, antimetastatic, and insecticidal benefits.

The reason that alkaloids are so important in this formula is that they are used to release serotonin and help with the balance of other neurotransmitters. They help consumers improve their overall well-being and boost their mood to feel more lighthearted and relaxed.

What Ingredients Are in Vana Mind?
----------------------------------

Within this formula, consumers get the support of cannabinoids, terpenes, essential oils, and even MCT oil to ensure that anyone can reach the balance they need to obliterate their stress. Though the official website doesn’t go into details about these ingredients, a review online of customer experiences shows that Vana Mind contains:

●    Full-spectrum CBD oil  
●    Cannabidiol oil  
●    Essential oils  
●    MCT oil  
Read below to learn a little more about the influence that each of these ingredients can have.

Full Spectrum Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil
-----------------------------------

The leader that carries this formula is full-spectrum cannabidiol oil or CBD oil. Consumers who use this formula will get about 150 mg of CBD oil in every serving, which is relatively potent compared to other tinctures. Most brands don’t offer 150 mg in their entire bottle, showing users how much more you are getting than from a CBD isolate.

CBD oil is nothing new for the healthcare industry, especially regarding stress levels. With the legalization of hemp through the 2018 Farm Bill, researchers have been able to dedicate time and money to researching the effect of CBD on the body. These discoveries verified that CBD can help consumers feel calmer, which is why some researchers suggest using it for anxiety and depression.

Though some brands will use CBD isolate or other remedies to improve their central nervous system, these options restrict CBD's effect. Offering a full-spectrum CBD source ensures that users can experience the "entourage effect," which enhances the overall psychoactive effects of the compounds in cannabis to work better when taken together and comes from the other cannabinoids that are inherently captured during the filtration process.

Cannabinol (CBN) Oil
--------------------

Although a substantial serving of CBD can be quite effective on its own, the creators of Vana Mind wanted to give consumers their best chance of finding relief. They combined CBD with another cannabinoid – cannabinol (CBN). With 650 mg of CBN in every bottle, consumers get approximately 21 mg in every serving. Since the typical dose of CBN use is only about 6 mg, consumers may need to start with just one drop if they’ve never experienced the effects of CBN.  
The psychoactive properties of CBN are mild, which is why they haven’t earned the same stringent regulation that THC falls under. It still provides stimulation to the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the same way that CBD can, but CBN's focus seems more direct to anxiety and stress rather than offering the overall effects that CBD does. Some people find the relaxing effects so sedating that they might become drowsy or fall asleep.  
Consumers should consider that CBN's full benefits are still uncertain because it hasn’t been as researched as other compounds from the cannabis plant. With a high concentration, a positive drug test result is possible.

Essential Oils
--------------

While the website doesn’t specifically name which essential oils are used, these ingredients have been used for years to influence the wellness of users. Essential oils are commonly found in aromatherapy to elicit a therapeutic response. This alternative medicine focuses on the benefits of plant extracts on the user’s health, and Vana Mind uses them to reduce stress on the body.

While essential oils have become a consistent part of many routines, there is still a lot of research to be done. These essential oils aren’t meant to offer a cure or a treatment for any medical conditions, but they can provide health benefits. One of the most consistent use cases is to help relieve stress or regulate mood, but the research on the direct impact they can make varies. Pairing essential oils with CBD and CBN can make a substantial difference.

MCT Oil
-------

MCT oil, or medium-chain triglyceride oil, is the base of this formula. This type of supplement provides molecules smaller than what consumers typically get in their diet, making it easier to process by the digestive system. Formulas with MCT oil focus on delivering nutrients to the body as quickly as possible to get the best support.

On its own, MCT oil can quickly boost the user’s energy levels, and researchers have found that it is quite helpful to individuals trying to lose weight. It reduces the growth of new bacteria and has been used by athletes who want to support their bodies through competitions while adhering to the current guidelines. Though this formula is not meant for weight loss directly, the inherent benefits of MCT oil help users burn more carbohydrates when they exercise, which can help them slim down. However, this benefit is still being studied by researchers.

When paired with the CBD, CBN, and essential oils discussed above, MCT oil helps the active ingredients make it through the digestive tract to ensure that the bloodstream gets as many compounds as possible. The purpose of MCT oil in this formula is to keep the formula stable and cohesive, promoting the maximum absorption of cannabinoids.

Other Complementary Ingredients
-------------------------------

Along with the ingredients listed above, consumers will also have the support of the alkaloids, terpenes, and chemicals that remain unnamed. Alkaloids, as explained above, help consumers release more serotonin, which inherently helps them feel happier and more balanced. Terpenes, on the other hand, come from using full-spectrum CBD and CBN, and they can cause the entourage effect that consumers can use to improve relaxation.
